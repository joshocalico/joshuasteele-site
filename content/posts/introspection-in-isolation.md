title: Introspection in isolation
draft: false
author: Joshua Steele

This is an introspection on my actions in the past year. I wish I could say it would say anything positive about me but... It really doesn't. 

I have a lot of problems, I haven't confronted them for a while - and now I honestly don't know how to resolve them. 

CW: Suicidality, mental health issues.

To understand where I'm starting from let's go back.

### Background

I had a pretty cruddy primary and teen years, this isn't my parents fault by any means. People just kind of suck.

I was a very na√Øve and gullible kid, people took advantage of me. They would ask me for help, of which I would oblige only for them to treat me like absolute garbage later. The bullying was relentless.

In a way high school was better - at least from the student body. I started to struggle by the time I hit Year 10. I started to fear my situation and I actually started to fear my teachers. To be fair some of this was warranted, when you're humiliated in front of your peers by people that are supposed to be educating you and you've been told that failure means you're screwed for life it can be hard to keep perspective. I also had the added fear of rejection as some people in my community were quite anti-gay and I was figuring out I definitely wasn't straight. I think my psychological breaking point was when I considered jumping off the school's roof. That is when I was referred to the school's counsellor. There were other times.

This was my first foray into mental health services. 

In university, things started off mostly ok but didn't really last. I've discovered I have some self destructive tendencies. Basically going from overworking to horrifically depressed. There is more that has happened during my time at uni that has affected my health severely, but I only talk about that with people I trust. That list of people which has shrunk gradually as I've aged.

So - Pretty awful to be honest.

There were good times too. I'm talking about this as it's relevant to the section ahead.

### The long march

So, I've had health issues for a while, as you'd know from the previous paragraph. Non physical, the invisible variety, the ones assholes pretend don't exist. For a while I did confront them, I took what I saw to be a risk, saw a medical professional and confessed that I'd been struggling for a while. Things started out okay enough, he asked whether I'd been through therapy and enumerated my options. For the fortunate of you not to need SSRIs, these things are nasty. The one I was on, Sertraline has a whole wikipedia article dedicated to its [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adverse_effects_of_sertraline).

I had a bad run with this. I felt really disoriented and nauseous, these symptoms weren't great but I could handle them. The difference here were the symptoms that happened later. I struggled to focus, think and even tasks like reading became difficult. My moods became very unstable and I fell into a deeper depression.

Unfortunately, where I was at my worst was also quite a busy time. 

If you were to look at my academic record at UniSA, it would be blatantly obvious where
