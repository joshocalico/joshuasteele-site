Myself of [Nitrocade](https://nitrocade.com) and Jye of [Drip Digital](https://dripdigital.tech) worked on a site for Nickelodeon's 2020 Spongebob Squarepants movie, Spongebob Squarepants: Sponge on the Run. The site made use of DeepAR and some nice self-developed wrappers to get it to play well with the React lifecycle.

Big ups to [Poplar](https://poplar.studio) for supporting us through the revisions and Jye for letting me in on the opportunity.
