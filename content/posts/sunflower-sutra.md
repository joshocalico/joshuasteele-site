# Hi there!

My name is Joshua Steele. I write software.

This is my first blog post on my new site.

So how does it work? Easy, I use **Gatsby**, **React** and a nice tool called **Forestry** to provide a nice CMS interface because I didn't feel like writing one today.

I'm hosting it on a really nice CDN so everything loads super fast.

## Did you make this?

Good question! I initially started from a template so I could get the boilerplate out of the way and started developing around that. So... yes. Mostly. Spending what time you read this. Which... I'm going to assume is after I've modified the site to my hearts content. 

If you see a portfolio section. I definitely have. I've really got to make one of those.

## Is this site Open Source?

Sure is! You can find the source code on my [GitHub](https://github.com/joshocalico/joshuasteele-site). It could get a bit murky looking at the  history though. Every post on Forestry generates a commit. If you want to know how I've done some particular React hackery, you are free to peruse.
