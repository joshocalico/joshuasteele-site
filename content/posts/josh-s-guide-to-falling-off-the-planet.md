**SPOILER:** The üëè earth üëè isn't üëè flat.

So you can't fall off. Physically.

How I'm managing with the increased stress and curveballs of COVID-19. 

**SPOILER Pt. 2:** I'm doing as well as the rest of us, so I'm not really. 

I'm trying some things though so, read on if you'd like:

Firstly - Hi to the zero people who read my blog: I don't know that - I intentionally don't have analytics. I like mystery. I also don't care if anyone reads my work.

So - what's happened and why are you posting now.

Well a few things. Mostly positive, I promise.

* I'm now officially a Web Developer of StudyLink.
* I'm part of Apple's Developer Program, expect some apps.
* I'm working on a lot of freelance projects. No NDA, but I refuse to tell you for now.
* The virus has made everything a lot harder, but I still have my job so I'm fortunate. I'm making an effort to contribute fiscally to the projects around me, I'm a part timer so I don't have a lot. I want to support people where I can though, I personally don't need much. 
* Uni is also way hard from home. I still love my degree but I'm not expecting good grades this year. It's way hard to contact my project client.
* I've been a rather lacklustre student rep due to declining mental health. I'm trying to figure out a way through it though. 

A lot right? I've noticed that I haven't really been handling doing this without others. 

I've devised that I need to make sure I'm doing the following:

* Self-care
* Exercise
* Some tasks
* Socialising
* Sleeping (Out of 5 - Scale)

In an effort to be accountable to myself on these, I'm going to post at least once a day.

I get depressed and my self-care slips - so this will act as a sort of late day stand-up. If this fails, I'm not going to hold it against myself. If you aren't me and you're feeling yourself start to struggle, I'd encourage you try it.

I understand that accountability won't help my mental health. But little tasks to keep myself in a decent shape likely will. I mean, to be honest I haven't even talked with my boyfriend nearly as much as I should be right now.

What did I do today?:

* Fixed my cruddy network with Google tech.
* Went for a walk in the sun and left the dark Josh cave.
* Did some code review on the freelance project.
* Spent some time with my family
* Talked over Discord - It's important.
* Blogged. üôÇ

Self-care: N, Exercise: Y, Tasks: Y, Socialising: Y, Sleep: 2 (4 hours! üò≠)

What will I do tomorrow?:

* I'm "at" StudyLink tomorrow. (WFH - I miss you all! üòâ)
* Get up nice and early and grab a coffee.
* Practice proper self-care.
* Do some OAuth2 code for social auth in my freelance stuff
* Maybe do some modifications to this site. It's about time.
* Try to do some more work on my VR project for Uni.
* Go for a walk.

Some things that'll have to wait include a cute Snapchat lens I'm making to spice up the daily Zoom meeting. Hint: It involves cats.

See you tomorrow. I mean it!

Proof I'm serious - with a bit of insight into an [expensive mistake](https://stock.adobe.com) I made a while ago.

Until tomorrow,
