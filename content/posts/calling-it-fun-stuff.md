I don't really have enough time to keep this thing going so my messages are getting kind of nonsensical.

I'll just talk about some things I liked today. All done while I was busy being productive of course ðŸ˜‰. Looking into the development of Windows 8 and XP, two wonderful videos by Michael MJD. I find them quite interesting and kind of a display of how systems start to become production ready.

I guess it's pretty telling of my relative inexperience with large projects in industry that I find such iteration interesting, or maybe it's just the fact that UX iteration is just super cool.

I keep working on my freelance projects, I unfortunately had to have an ops day per se, although I've done some limited coding. So my day was spent basically integrating our workflow so we can keep our code deploying with zero intervention. How I love Heroku and Netlify, an absolute dream!

Of course, not going to be the production platform we have other platforms for that.

I hear you say, why not JAMstack? Well. The site is pretty dynamic and user facing. At least for now that space sits out of JAMstack's forte.

One fortunate thing is Python has had a usage resurgence for me, which I'm glad for. It's just such a pleasant language. My freelance work is using it too! Just don't tell my work I know PL/SQL ðŸ˜…. Despite my general squeamishness at the thought of it I'm considering learning CFML, not for ColdFusion but  for Lucee. If I'm even slightly more useful at work I think I'll be happy.

The 5: Social: N, Self-care: Y, Sleep: 3, Exercise: Y, Tasks: Y

Today I did work so we can do work, how meta.

Until tomorrow,

Joshua Steele
