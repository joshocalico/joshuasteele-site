Told ya I'd be back.

Short one today. 

* I wrote some slightly broken unit tests!
* Did some web dev.
* Said hi to some people online.
* Had some less fun meetings.
* Smashed my hands against a keyboard real fast.

Self care - M, Exercise - Y, Tasks - M, Socialising - Y, Sleep 2.5 (5 hours)

Tomorrow:

* AR/VR/Spaghetti code.
* Finish some rep obligations, spaghetti documents.
* Web spaghetti code.
* Eat hi carb delicious foodstuff.

In all honesty, the list isn't getting shorter.

Let's keep trying.

From your spaghetti code cowboy.
