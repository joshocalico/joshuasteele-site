The final personal post for a while. I promise.

This is an introspection on my actions in the past year. I wish I could say it would reflect positively on me but, it really doesn't.

I have a lot of problems, I haven't confronted them for a while - and now I honestly don't know how to resolve them.

To understand where I'm starting from let's go back.

### Background

\[CW: Suicidality, mental health issues.\]

I had a pretty cruddy primary and teen years, this isn't my parents fault by any means. People just kind of suck.

I was a very na√Øve and gullible kid, people took advantage of me. They would ask me for help, of which I would oblige only for them to treat me like absolute garbage later. The bullying was relentless.

In a way high school was better - at least from the student body. I started to struggle by the time I hit Year 10. I started to fear my situation and I actually started to fear my teachers. To be fair some of this was warranted, when you're humiliated in front of your peers by people that are supposed to be educating you and you've been told that failure means you're screwed for life it can be hard to keep perspective. I also had the added fear of rejection as some people in my community were quite anti-gay and I was figuring out I definitely wasn't straight. I think my psychological breaking point was when I considered jumping off the school's roof. That is when I was referred to the school's counsellor. There were other times.

This was my first foray into mental health services.

In university, things started off mostly ok but didn't really last. I've discovered I have some self destructive tendencies. Basically going from overworking to horrifically depressed. There is more that has happened during my time at uni that has affected my health severely, but I only talk about that with people I trust. That list of people which has shrunk gradually as I've aged.

So - Pretty awful to be honest.

There were good times too. I'm talking about this as it's relevant to the section ahead.

### The long march

So, I've had health issues for a while, as you'd know from the previous paragraph. Non physical, the invisible variety, the ones assholes pretend don't exist. For a while I did confront them, I took what I saw to be a risk, saw a medical professional and confessed that I'd been struggling for a while. Things started out okay enough, he asked whether I'd been through therapy and enumerated my options. For the fortunate of you not to need SSRIs, these things are nasty. The one I was on, Sertraline has a whole wikipedia article dedicated to its [side effects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_adverse_effects_of_sertraline).

I had a bad run with this. I felt really disoriented and nauseous, these symptoms weren't great but I could handle them. The difference here were the symptoms that happened later. I struggled to focus, think and even tasks like reading became difficult. My moods became very unstable and I fell into a deeper depression.

Unfortunately, where I was at my worst was also quite a busy time.

If you were to look at my academic record of my B SoftEng. at UniSA, it would be blatantly obvious where this point in time is.

I however made a mistake here, at this time.

I got scared.

### Introspection, served with isolation

What happened between that year and now? I played ignorant with my own mental health and cut out a major tool to help manage it.

My mental health issues are chronic, or at least they've been around for a long time.

Therapy is helpful for managing my state, but it is not a solution.

I need to go back and see someone, be it a doctor or psychiatrist so I can explore this option again. This time, I will tell my family that I'm going on medication (if the professional deems it necessary) and I will explore creating an access plan to account for the _messy_ period. 

_"But,"_ I hear me posing as a reader enquire _"Why now? If you haven't addressed this for over a year, what makes now special?"_. Easy. I'm locked in a room, _by myself_. 

I've noticed something about me. I can ignore my problems if I pour my life into work or when I'm with other people. I have other things on my mind.

This is somehow a lot harder to implement by yourself. I could tell I was really struggling, because I actually let myself notice.

How is this an unresolvable problem? The above part isn't the issue rather, the future solution. Treatment is important.

The issue is, I've let a debt build. Not a financial one, but a work one.

Through a combination of health management denial and depression, I've let something I would normally put first, (my work) slip through the cracks.

I hope to have some good news to report, but I'm not too sure.

Look after yourself - and don't be a [COVIDiot](https://www.nydailynews.com/coronavirus/ny-coronavirus-covidiot-pandemic-flu-influencer-20200331-5rfux5nmrjbzvehumhibsl5mme-story.html).

Back soon,
